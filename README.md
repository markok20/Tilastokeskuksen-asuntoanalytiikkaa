Statistics Finland's open data: The prices of old share housing vary in Finland

How have the prices of old condominiums developed over the past year in the Helsinki metropolitan area and elsewhere in Finland? Have prices developed in the same direction or in different directions? The question is essential because most of Finnish property is located on floors, walls and ceilings.

I searched for answers to these questions when I went through Statistics Finland's databases and made a selection from 2015-2021 (Price index of old share dwellings (2015 = 100)). The sample was the number of transactions per month ".

The database can be accessed at http://pxnet2.stat.fi/PXWeb/pxweb/fi/StatFin/StatFin__asu__ashi__kk/?tablelist=true I processed the material with Python. At the end of the article is a link to the Python code.

How have the prices of old condominiums developed over the past year in the Helsinki metropolitan area and elsewhere in Finland? The figure below shows the development in which prices have sharply differentiated since 2015 in the Helsinki metropolitan area and elsewhere in Finland.

In 2021, the price per square meter in the Helsinki Metropolitan Area has risen by about 22 per cent to 4,300 euros, while in 2015 the square meter cost about 3,500 euros in the whole country.

Elsewhere in Finland, the price per square meter has fluctuated as if seasonally in 2015â€“2021. In 2015, elsewhere in Finland, a square cost about 1610 euros, while in 2021 a square cost about 1650 euros. The price level has thus remained relatively stable.

In 2021, the price per square meter in the whole country has risen by about ten percent to 2,300 euros, while in 2015 the square meter cost about 2,100 euros in the whole country.
